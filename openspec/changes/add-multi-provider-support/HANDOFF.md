# Handoff — add-multi-provider-support

This file is the running progress log for the change. It is **not** an
OpenSpec-tracked artifact — `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `specs/`, and
`tasks.md` are.

## Status: **READY TO TEST LOCALLY** ✅

All 26 sections of `tasks.md` are content-complete except §23, which is
an unscripted manual e2e dry-run that requires a live codex session.
The branches in both repos are mergeable; the only step remaining
before GA is the user's local validation against a real codex auth.

### Branches

- `specrails-core: feat/codex-provider-support` — 1 commit, +1254/-58
  LOC, 175 tests pass.
- `specrails-hub: feat/multi-provider-support` — 23 commits,
  +6910/-837 LOC, server 1788/1789 (lone pre-existing smash-runner
  fail outside scope), client 1818/1818.

### What was shipped (all stages)

| Stage | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Hub adapter architecture + codex correctness across every manager | ✅ |
| **B** | specrails-core 4.6.0: lift 3 gates + extend scaffold + rail SKILL.md + apply codex settings | ✅ |
| **C-gates** | hub-router + AddProjectDialog + useHub.tsx accept codex | ✅ |
| **C-§22** | AnalyticsPage: tilde + Hero footnote + ProviderBreakdownCard | ✅ |
| **C-§25** | docs/codex.md user guide + docs/adding-a-provider.md + README + CLAUDE.md | ✅ |
| **C-§23** | Manual e2e dry-run | ⏳ (user) |
| **C-§26** | Rollout via SPECRAILS_HUB_CODEX_BETA env var | ✅ wired; default ON |

## How to test locally

The user asked to test specrails-core + specrails-hub end-to-end. Here
is the exact sequence.

### One-time setup

```bash
# 1. Build + link specrails-core locally so the hub picks up the local
#    4.6.0-equivalent code (the npm-published version is still 4.5.0).
cd /Users/javi/repos/specrails-core
npm install        # if needed
npm run build
npm link

# 2. Confirm the link works
which specrails-core    # should print the global symlink
specrails-core --version

# 3. Make sure codex is installed and authenticated
codex --version         # require ≥ 0.128.0
codex login             # if not already authenticated

# 4. (Optional) install uv if you want to test the Serena plugin
brew install uv         # macOS — or follow https://docs.astral.sh/uv
```

### Run the hub against the local core

```bash
cd /Users/javi/repos/specrails-hub
npm install        # if needed

# Force the hub to use the locally-linked specrails-core instead of the
# npm-published 4.5.0. Without this, codex installs would fail because
# 4.5.0 still has the gates up.
export SPECRAILS_CORE_BIN=specrails-core

npm run dev        # starts server (4200) + client (4201)
```

Open http://localhost:4201.

### Smoke test 1 — Add a codex project

1. Click **Add Project**.
2. Pick a fresh path under `/tmp` or any empty git-initialised dir.
3. In the **AI provider** row, click **Codex** (should be enabled if
   `codex` is on PATH).
4. Submit. The setup wizard runs `specrails-core init --provider
   codex --quick`. Expect to see `.codex/`, `.codex/skills/...`,
   `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/config.toml`, `.codex/rules.star` populated.
5. Confirm the setup checkpoints all reach "done".

### Smoke test 2 — Generate a spec via Quick mode

1. From the project page, click **Add Spec**.
2. Type any idea, leave the mode on Quick.
3. Submit. The hub spawns `codex exec --json --sandbox workspace-write
   ...`. Expect a ticket to land in the dashboard within a few seconds.
4. Open the Analytics page. The new ticket's invocation should appear
   in the Raw table with a `~` prefix on the cost cell (estimated).
5. The Hero should show "· includes ~$X.XX estimated" next to the
   invocation count.

### Smoke test 3 — Multi-turn Explore Spec

1. Open **Add Spec** → **Explore**.
2. Type a few rounds of refinement (≥ 3 user turns). Each turn after
   the first should run `codex exec resume <UUID>` — you can verify in
   the server log; the conversation row's `session_id` column in the
   per-project SQLite should hold the real codex thread UUID, not
   anything starting with `codex-`.
3. Click **Create Spec**. Confirm the ticket is created.

### Smoke test 4 — Install Serena on the codex project

Requires `uv` installed and codex auth working.

1. Open **Settings → Integrations** (or wherever your build exposes
   the Plugins UI).
2. Install Serena. The hub spawns `codex mcp add serena -- uvx ...`
   with `CODEX_HOME=~/.specrails/projects/<slug>/codex-home/`.
3. Confirm `~/.specrails/projects/<slug>/codex-home/config.toml`
   exists with a `[mcp_servers.serena]` block.
4. Confirm `AGENTS.md` gains the
   `<!-- specrails-hub-managed:serena:start/end -->` block.

### Smoke test 5 — Side-by-side with a claude project

1. Add a claude project next to the codex one. Both should coexist —
   no interference.
2. The Analytics page on the codex project should NOT show the
   `ProviderBreakdownCard` (single provider). Add at least one
   invocation on the claude side, then on the codex side, of a
   shared metric — wait, they're separate projects; never mind.
   Instead, verify the card renders correctly on a project that has
   both providers represented in `ai_invocations` history (won't
   happen organically — would require manually mixing rows).

### Smoke test 6 — Emergency rollback

```bash
SPECRAILS_HUB_CODEX_BETA=0 npm run dev
```

The Add Project dialog should show Codex as **disabled / not found**
even when the binary is on PATH. POST `/api/hub/projects` with
`provider: 'codex'` should return HTTP 400 with a message naming the
env var.

## Test status (CI mirror)

```
Hub server:    PASS (1788) FAIL (1)   ← pre-existing smash-runner WIP
Hub client:    PASS (1818) FAIL (0)
specrails-core: PASS (175)  FAIL (0)
```

## How to ship to production

1. Merge `specrails-core feat/codex-provider-support` to its main.
   release-please will bump to 4.6.0 and publish to npm.
2. Wait for npm to propagate (~1-2 min).
3. Drop the `SPECRAILS_CORE_BIN=specrails-core` env var from your dev
   environment so the hub goes back to using `npx
   specrails-core@latest` and picks up 4.6.0.
4. Verify the smoke tests above one more time with the published
   version.
5. Merge `specrails-hub feat/multi-provider-support` to main.
   `SPECRAILS_HUB_CODEX_BETA` env var remains as the emergency
   rollback for the first week or two.
6. Once stable, drop the env-var docs and call it generally available.

## Pre-existing repo state to be aware of

- `git stash list` on the hub shows 30+ entries. The first is
  `claude-model-auth-fix-wip`. Never run bare `git stash pop`.
- `server/project-router.ts` and `server/smash-runner.ts` have
  pre-existing TypeScript errors and 1 pre-existing test failure
  outside this change's scope. They also prevent the codex-specific
  project-router test file from loading; the route handler refactor
  is verified by the typecheck and the other test suites that don't
  depend on those broken imports.
