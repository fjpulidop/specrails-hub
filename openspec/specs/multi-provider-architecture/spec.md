# multi-provider-architecture Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-multi-provider-support. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: ProviderAdapter interface is the single integration point

The app SHALL define a TypeScript interface `ProviderAdapter` in `server/providers/provider-adapter.ts` that every provider implements. Manager code (chat, queue, agent-refine, setup, profile, plugin, explore-cwd, result-event, project-router) MUST consume the adapter exclusively for spawn-time decisions (argv shape, stream parsing, session-id capture, result normalisation, MCP registration mode, filesystem-convention paths). No new `if (provider === '<id>')` branch SHALL be introduced in manager code; existing such branches MUST be migrated to capability-flag or method dispatches as those managers are touched.

#### Scenario: Adding a third provider does not require manager changes
- **WHEN** a developer adds `server/providers/example-adapter.ts` exporting an object that implements `ProviderAdapter` and registers it in `server/providers/registry.ts`
- **THEN** the new provider becomes addressable end-to-end (Add Project, spawn, stream parse, profile validation, plugin install) with no changes to `chat-manager.ts`, `queue-manager.ts`, `agent-refine-manager.ts`, `setup-manager.ts`, `profile-manager.ts`, `plugin-manager.ts`, `result-event.ts`, or `explore-cwd-manager.ts`

#### Scenario: Manager dispatches on capabilities, not provider id
- **WHEN** any manager needs to decide whether to call `--resume <sessionId>` or its equivalent
- **THEN** the decision MUST be expressed as `if (adapter.capabilities.nativeResume) { adapter.buildArgs('chat-resume', { sessionId, ... }) }` rather than `if (provider === 'claude')`

### Requirement: Provider registry exposes lookup by id

The app SHALL expose a `providerRegistry` exporting `getAdapter(id: string): ProviderAdapter`, `listAdapters(): ProviderAdapter[]`, and `hasAdapter(id: string): boolean`. Lookups for unknown ids SHALL throw `UnknownProviderError`. The registry MUST be populated at module-load time by importing each adapter's registration call.

#### Scenario: Lookup returns the matching adapter
- **WHEN** `getAdapter('claude')` is called
- **THEN** the returned adapter has `id === 'claude'`, `binary === 'claude'`, `instructionsFilename === 'CLAUDE.md'`, `projectDirName === '.claude'`

#### Scenario: Lookup for unknown provider throws
- **WHEN** `getAdapter('does-not-exist')` is called
- **THEN** the call throws `UnknownProviderError` whose message names the unknown id and lists registered ids

#### Scenario: listAdapters returns every registered provider
- **WHEN** `listAdapters()` is called after module load
- **THEN** the returned array includes `claude` and `codex` adapters

### Requirement: Adapter exposes filesystem and CLI conventions

Every adapter MUST expose, as readonly properties, the conventions its CLI imposes on the project filesystem and the binary it spawns:
- `id: string` — kebab-case unique identifier
- `displayName: string` — human-readable name used by UI
- `binary: string` — the executable to spawn (`claude`, `codex`, ...)
- `minCliVersion: string | null` — minimum supported CLI version (semver string) or `null` when no pin
- `projectDirName: string` — the directory the provider's CLI scaffolds (`.claude`, `.codex`, ...)
- `instructionsFilename: string` — the top-level instructions file the provider's CLI reads on startup (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, ...)
- `mcpRegistration: 'project-json' | 'cli-add'` — how MCP servers are declared for this provider

#### Scenario: Claude adapter declares its conventions
- **WHEN** the claude adapter is inspected
- **THEN** `projectDirName === '.claude'`, `instructionsFilename === 'CLAUDE.md'`, `mcpRegistration === 'project-json'`, `binary === 'claude'`

#### Scenario: Codex adapter declares its conventions
- **WHEN** the codex adapter is inspected
- **THEN** `projectDirName === '.codex'`, `instructionsFilename === 'AGENTS.md'`, `mcpRegistration === 'cli-add'`, `binary === 'codex'`

### Requirement: Adapter exposes a capability-flag block

Every adapter MUST expose a readonly `capabilities` object containing at least:
- `nativeResume: boolean` — true when the CLI supports resuming a session by id natively (no synthetic id workaround)
- `nativeStreamJson: boolean` — true when the CLI emits JSONL events natively (i.e. `--json` or equivalent)
- `nativeCostUsd: boolean` — true when the CLI reports `total_cost_usd` in its terminal event
- `nativeOtelEnv: boolean` — true when the CLI honours environment variables to emit OTLP (e.g. Claude's `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY`)
- `profileEnvSupport: boolean` — true when the provider's runtime reads `SPECRAILS_PROFILE_PATH` to apply profile resolution
- `systemPromptArg: boolean` — true when the CLI accepts a `--system-prompt`-style flag (false means the system prompt MUST be folded into the user prompt)

#### Scenario: Claude adapter capabilities
- **WHEN** the claude adapter's `capabilities` is read
- **THEN** all six flags are `true`

#### Scenario: Codex adapter capabilities reflect 0.128.0 behaviour
- **WHEN** the codex adapter's `capabilities` is read
- **THEN** `nativeResume === true`, `nativeStreamJson === true`, `nativeOtelEnv === false`, `nativeCostUsd === false`, `profileEnvSupport === true`, `systemPromptArg === false`

### Requirement: Adapter exposes a typed model catalog

Every adapter MUST expose:
- `modelCatalog(): readonly { value: string; label: string; default?: boolean }[]` — the full list of models valid for this provider, with at most one entry marked `default: true`
- `defaultModel(): string` — the `value` of the default entry, returned as a stable string regardless of catalog ordering

The model catalog is the single source of truth for: profile schema validation, the Add Spec model picker dropdown, `POST /tickets/generate-spec` model validation, and the `/api/projects/:id/default-spec-model` endpoint's `allowed` field.

#### Scenario: defaultModel matches a catalog entry
- **WHEN** any adapter is queried
- **THEN** `defaultModel()` returns a string equal to some `catalog[i].value` where `catalog[i].default === true`

#### Scenario: Server validation uses the catalog
- **WHEN** `POST /tickets/generate-spec` validates a request body's `model` field for a project whose provider is `<id>`
- **THEN** the validation calls `getAdapter(id).modelCatalog().map(m => m.value)` and rejects values not in that list

### Requirement: Adapter builds spawn args per action

Every adapter MUST implement `buildArgs(action: SpawnAction, opts: SpawnOptions): string[]` that returns the complete `argv` (excluding the binary name) for spawning the CLI for the named action. The supported actions MUST include at least:
- `chat-turn` — first turn of a chat conversation
- `chat-resume` — turn 2+ of a chat conversation, given a captured session id
- `rail-job` — a pipeline job spawned by QueueManager
- `spec-gen` — a Quick spec generation
- `agent-refine` — an AI Edit refine turn
- `setup-enrich` — the post-install enrich pass

`SpawnOptions` MUST carry at least `prompt: string`, `systemPrompt?: string`, `model: string`, `sessionId?: string`, `maxTurns?: number`, `attachmentTextBlocks?: string[]`. Adapters whose CLI lacks `systemPromptArg` MUST fold `systemPrompt` into the prompt instead of emitting a flag.

#### Scenario: Claude chat-turn argv
- **WHEN** `claudeAdapter.buildArgs('chat-turn', { prompt: 'hi', systemPrompt: 'sys', model: 'sonnet' })` is called
- **THEN** the result is `['--model', 'sonnet', '--dangerously-skip-permissions', '--tools', 'default', '--output-format', 'stream-json', '--verbose', '--system-prompt', 'sys', '-p', 'hi']`

#### Scenario: Codex chat-turn argv has no --system-prompt flag
- **WHEN** `codexAdapter.buildArgs('chat-turn', { prompt: 'hi', systemPrompt: 'sys', model: 'gpt-5.4-mini' })` is called
- **THEN** the result is `['exec', '--json', 'sys\n\n---\n\nhi', '--model', 'gpt-5.4-mini']`
- **AND** no element starts with `--system-prompt`

#### Scenario: Codex chat-resume uses exec resume
- **WHEN** `codexAdapter.buildArgs('chat-resume', { prompt: 'next', sessionId: 'UUID', model: 'gpt-5.4-mini' })` is called
- **THEN** the result is `['exec', 'resume', '--json', 'UUID', 'next', '--model', 'gpt-5.4-mini']`

### Requirement: Adapter parses stream lines into uniform events

Every adapter MUST implement `parseStreamLine(line: string): AdapterEvent | null`, where `AdapterEvent` is a discriminated union of at minimum:
- `{ kind: 'text-delta', text: string }`
- `{ kind: 'tool-use', name: string, inputPreview: string }`
- `{ kind: 'session-started', sessionId: string }`
- `{ kind: 'result', payload: Record<string, unknown> }`
- `{ kind: 'other', type: string, raw: Record<string, unknown> }`

Lines that do not parse as JSON, or that the adapter does not recognise, MUST be returned as `kind: 'other'` (never as `null` for valid JSONL). `null` is reserved for empty lines or lines the adapter declares non-event (e.g. plain text noise when the provider does not support JSONL).

#### Scenario: Codex thread.started maps to session-started
- **WHEN** `codexAdapter.parseStreamLine('{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"019e37c6-..."}')` is called
- **THEN** the result is `{ kind: 'session-started', sessionId: '019e37c6-...' }`

#### Scenario: Codex item.completed with agent_message maps to text-delta
- **WHEN** `codexAdapter.parseStreamLine('{"type":"item.completed","item":{"type":"agent_message","text":"hello"}}')` is called
- **THEN** the result is `{ kind: 'text-delta', text: 'hello' }`

#### Scenario: Codex turn.completed maps to result
- **WHEN** `codexAdapter.parseStreamLine('{"type":"turn.completed","usage":{"input_tokens":100,"output_tokens":5}}')` is called
- **THEN** the result is `{ kind: 'result', payload: { type: 'turn.completed', usage: { input_tokens: 100, output_tokens: 5 } } }`

#### Scenario: Claude `assistant` event maps to text-delta
- **WHEN** `claudeAdapter.parseStreamLine('{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"hi"}]}}')` is called
- **THEN** the result is `{ kind: 'text-delta', text: 'hi' }`

#### Scenario: Unknown event types are captured as other
- **WHEN** any adapter receives a JSON line with an unknown `type`
- **THEN** the result is `{ kind: 'other', type: '<unknown>', raw: <parsed> }`
- **AND** the call does not throw

### Requirement: Adapter extracts a normalised result from a stream

Every adapter MUST implement `extractResult(events: AdapterEvent[]): NormalisedResult` returning the canonical result shape used by `ai_invocations`:
- `tokens_in?: number`
- `tokens_out?: number`
- `tokens_cache_read?: number`
- `tokens_cache_create?: number`
- `total_cost_usd?: number` (only when `capabilities.nativeCostUsd === true`)
- `num_turns?: number`
- `model?: string`
- `duration_ms?: number`
- `duration_api_ms?: number`
- `session_id?: string`

Fields the provider does not report MUST be `undefined` (NULL when persisted). Cost calculation for providers without native cost reporting happens outside the adapter (via `server/pricing.ts`).

#### Scenario: Codex extractResult populates tokens but omits cost
- **GIVEN** an event stream containing one `session-started` and one `result` carrying `turn.completed.usage`
- **WHEN** `codexAdapter.extractResult(events)` is called
- **THEN** `tokens_in`, `tokens_out`, `tokens_cache_read`, `session_id`, and `model` are populated
- **AND** `total_cost_usd` is `undefined`

#### Scenario: Claude extractResult populates tokens and cost
- **GIVEN** an event stream containing one Claude `result` event with `total_cost_usd: 0.012` and `usage: { input_tokens: 100, output_tokens: 50, cache_read_input_tokens: 10 }`
- **WHEN** `claudeAdapter.extractResult(events)` is called
- **THEN** `total_cost_usd === 0.012`, `tokens_in === 100`, `tokens_out === 50`, `tokens_cache_read === 10`

### Requirement: Adapter declares baseline agents and detects installation

Every adapter MUST implement:
- `baselineAgents(): readonly string[]` — the agent ids profile validation considers mandatory (e.g. `['sr-architect', 'sr-developer', 'sr-reviewer', 'sr-merge-resolver']`)
- `detectInstalled(): Promise<DetectionResult>` — returns `{ installed: boolean; executable: boolean; version?: string; meetsMinimum?: boolean }`. Implementations MUST complete within 3 seconds; longer must resolve to `{ installed: false }` rather than hang.

`baselineAgents()` is consumed by `ProfileManager.validateStructural` to know which agent ids must be present in any profile's chain.

#### Scenario: Both default adapters declare the same baseline
- **WHEN** `claudeAdapter.baselineAgents()` and `codexAdapter.baselineAgents()` are compared
- **THEN** they return arrays with the same set of strings (order may differ)

#### Scenario: detectInstalled honours minVersion when set
- **GIVEN** `codexAdapter.minCliVersion === '0.128.0'`
- **WHEN** `codexAdapter.detectInstalled()` runs against a system with codex 0.120.0
- **THEN** the result is `{ installed: true, executable: true, version: '0.120.0', meetsMinimum: false }`

#### Scenario: detectInstalled handles missing binary
- **WHEN** the binary is not on PATH
- **THEN** the result is `{ installed: false, executable: false }`

### Requirement: Provider discovery endpoint walks the registry

The app SHALL expose `GET /api/available-providers` returning `{ <providerId>: boolean, ..., tiers: ('quick' | 'full')[] }` where each key is the id of a registered provider and the boolean reflects whether that provider's CLI is currently detectable on the host. The endpoint MUST NOT hardcode any provider id; the response shape MUST be derived from `providerRegistry.listAdapters()`. The `tiers` array MUST include `'quick'` always; `'full'` only when at least one provider's CLI is detected.

#### Scenario: Endpoint reports detected state for every registered provider
- **WHEN** `GET /api/available-providers` is called on a host where claude is installed and codex is not
- **THEN** the response is `{ claude: true, codex: false, tiers: ['quick', 'full'] }`

#### Scenario: Endpoint shape extends to new providers automatically
- **WHEN** a third provider `example` is registered and its binary is on PATH
- **THEN** `GET /api/available-providers` returns an object with a top-level `example: true` key alongside `claude` and `codex`
- **AND** no source-code change to `desktop-router.ts` is required for the new key to appear

### Requirement: POST /projects accepts any registered provider id

The app SHALL accept `provider: <id>` in the body of `POST /api/projects` if and only if `providerRegistry.hasAdapter(id)`. Unknown ids MUST be rejected with HTTP 400 and a body identifying the unknown id and listing the registered ids. The default when `provider` is omitted MUST be `'claude'` (preserves backwards compatibility for existing client code paths).

#### Scenario: Codex project creation succeeds
- **WHEN** a client POSTs `{ path: '/tmp/ok', provider: 'codex' }` to a host with codex installed and the path being a valid directory
- **THEN** the response is HTTP 201 with the new project row carrying `provider: 'codex'`

#### Scenario: Unknown provider id rejected
- **WHEN** a client POSTs `{ path: '/tmp/ok', provider: 'turbofake' }`
- **THEN** the response is HTTP 400 with an error naming `turbofake` as unknown and listing `claude` and `codex` as valid ids

### Requirement: Setup-prerequisites reports every registered provider

`GET /api/setup-prerequisites` SHALL include one entry per registered provider in the prerequisites array. Each entry MUST report `installed`, `executable`, `version`, and `meetsMinimum` derived from the adapter's `detectInstalled()`. The endpoint MUST surface a project as installable when at least one provider is in a usable state (`installed && executable && meetsMinimum !== false`).

#### Scenario: Both providers usable
- **WHEN** claude and codex are both installed at supported versions
- **THEN** the response contains entries for both, each with `installed: true, executable: true, meetsMinimum: true`
- **AND** `ok: true` at the top level

#### Scenario: Neither provider usable blocks Add Project
- **WHEN** neither provider is installed
- **THEN** the response has both entries with `installed: false`
- **AND** `ok: false`
- **AND** the existing client `prereqsBlock` logic in `AddProjectDialog` continues to disable the Add Project submit button

### Requirement: Provider field on project is immutable post-creation

The app SHALL NOT expose any endpoint that changes a project's `provider` after creation. The `provider` column on `projects` is set on `POST /projects` and is read-only thereafter. UI surfaces that display the provider SHALL render it as informational, not as a control.

#### Scenario: No PATCH endpoint accepts provider
- **WHEN** any existing `PATCH /api/projects/:id` or per-project settings endpoint is inspected
- **THEN** none of them accept a `provider` field
- **AND** sending one is silently dropped or rejected with 400 depending on the endpoint's strictness mode

#### Scenario: SettingsPage shows provider as read-only
- **WHEN** the user opens SettingsPage for a project
- **THEN** the provider name is visible (e.g. as a badge or label)
- **AND** no input control exists to change it

### Requirement: Provider-aware filesystem conventions are honoured by all writers

Every app-managed writer of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.claude/*` / `.codex/*` paths MUST resolve the filename via `adapter.instructionsFilename` and the directory via `adapter.projectDirName`. Hardcoded paths to `.claude/` or `CLAUDE.md` in manager code are forbidden going forward; any pre-existing hardcoded paths MUST be migrated when the surrounding code is touched.

#### Scenario: Explore-cwd writes the right instructions file
- **WHEN** the explore-cwd is materialised for a codex project
- **THEN** the file written is `AGENTS.md`
- **AND** no file named `CLAUDE.md` is created in the codex project's explore-cwd

#### Scenario: Plugin contributors write to the right instructions file
- **WHEN** a plugin's shared-file contributor runs on a codex project
- **THEN** the contributor's `<!-- specrails-desktop-managed:<plugin> -->` block is written to `AGENTS.md`
- **AND** the project's `CLAUDE.md` is not touched (and need not exist)

### Requirement: Minimum CLI version is enforced at startup

When `adapter.minCliVersion` is non-null, the app SHALL surface an error in `setup-prerequisites` if the detected CLI version is less than the minimum. The error MUST include the detected version, the required minimum, and an upgrade hint. Spawn-time enforcement MUST NOT block: managers SHALL spawn the CLI regardless and let the CLI's own error path surface to the user via existing stderr capture.

#### Scenario: Old codex version surfaced in prerequisites
- **GIVEN** `codexAdapter.minCliVersion === '0.128.0'` and the host has codex 0.120.0
- **WHEN** `GET /api/setup-prerequisites` is called
- **THEN** the codex entry reports `installed: true, executable: true, meetsMinimum: false, version: '0.120.0'`
- **AND** the entry's `error` field names `0.128.0` as the minimum and includes an `upgrade hint`

#### Scenario: Spawning an old version still proceeds
- **GIVEN** the codex version on disk is below the minimum
- **WHEN** a job spawns
- **THEN** the spawn still happens (no pre-flight version block)
- **AND** if codex 0.120.0 fails to parse `--json` flags the resulting stderr surfaces via the existing failed-job error path
