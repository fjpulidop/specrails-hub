# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is this

specrails-hub is a local dashboard and CLI for managing multiple [specrails-core](https://github.com/fjpulidop/specrails-core) projects from a single interface. It visualizes AI pipeline phases (Architect → Developer → Reviewer → Ship), streams Claude CLI logs in real-time, and provides job queues, analytics, and chat per project.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Start server (4200) + client (4201) concurrently
npm run dev:server       # Server only with tsx watch
npm run dev:client       # Vite dev client only
npm run build            # Production build: client (tsc + vite) then CLI (tsc)
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript check both server and client
npm test                 # Run vitest (server + CLI tests)
npm run test:watch       # Vitest in watch mode
```

Tests use vitest with `:memory:` SQLite databases. Run a single test file:
```bash
npx vitest run server/db.test.ts
```

## Architecture

### Three-layer monorepo

```
server/     → Express + WebSocket + SQLite (TypeScript, CommonJS)
client/     → React + Vite + Tailwind v4 (TypeScript, ESM)
cli/        → specrails-hub CLI bridge (TypeScript, CommonJS)
```

Server and CLI compile to CommonJS (`tsconfig.json`). Client is ESM with its own `client/tsconfig.json`. Two separate `npm install` are needed (root + `client/`).

### Hub mode

The server runs in **hub mode** — one Express process manages multiple projects. Hub is the only supported mode.

**Data layout:**
```
~/.specrails/
  hub.sqlite              # project registry
  manager.pid             # server PID
  projects/<slug>/jobs.sqlite   # per-project DB
```

**Key server modules:**
- `hub-db.ts` — hub-level SQLite (project registry CRUD)
- `project-registry.ts` — `ProjectRegistry` class: loads per-project `ProjectContext` (DB, QueueManager, ChatManager, SetupManager) at startup
- `hub-router.ts` — `/api/hub/*` routes (projects CRUD, resolve by path, settings)
- `project-router.ts` — `/api/projects/:projectId/*` routes (all per-project operations)
- `index.ts` — entry point, mode detection, mounts both routers

**Per-project isolation:** Each `ProjectContext` gets its own SQLite, QueueManager, ChatManager. The `boundBroadcast` closure injects `projectId` into all WebSocket messages — no constructor changes needed on managers.

### Client architecture

- `App.tsx` mounts `HubProvider` and `HubApp` unconditionally
- `useHub.tsx` — `HubProvider` context: project list, active project, setup wizard state
- `getApiBase()` (`lib/api.ts`) — module-level store returns `/api/projects/<id>` for the active project; throws when no project is set. Updated by `HubProvider` on project switch.
- `useProjectCache.ts` — stale-while-revalidate cache per project to eliminate flicker on tab switch
- `useProjectRouteMemory` (in `App.tsx`) — saves/restores URL route per project

**Per-project tab switch pattern:** All pages and hooks use `activeProjectId` as a `useEffect` dependency. On switch: cached data shown instantly, fresh data fetched in background. Never reset to empty state.

**Job Detail page surfaces.** The Job Detail page (`client/src/pages/JobDetailPage.tsx`) renders two purpose-built components: `JobStatusPanel` (`client/src/components/JobStatusPanel.tsx`, formerly `JobCompletionSummary`) which renders for `running`, `completed`, and `failed` jobs with a header label/icon mapped to status, a 1-second ticker for live Duration, an incremental `useReducer`-based aggregator that derives Turns and Tokens from streamed `assistant` events (tolerant of missing `usage` fields), and Cost shown as `—` until the authoritative `total_cost_usd` arrives at job exit. `JobTicketHeader` (`client/src/components/JobTicketHeader.tsx`) renders a premium ticket-identity card above the existing job info row whenever the server resolves at least one ticket from the job's `command` (the `tickets[]` field on `GET /jobs/:id`); list mode at 2–3 tickets, compact `+ N more` mode with expand chevron at ≥4. Clicking a chip routes through `TicketDetailModalProvider` (`client/src/context/TicketDetailModalContext.tsx`) — a thin context mounted at the App root that opens the existing `TicketDetailModal` over the page without changing the route.

**Tablet split-view spec compare.** `TicketDetailModalProvider` (`client/src/context/TicketDetailModalContext.tsx`) now tracks split state `{ leftId, rightId, originSide, splitRatio }` on top of the existing centered-modal API (`openTicketDetail`, `closeTicketDetail`). Dragging a `TicketDetailModal` header past 20% of the viewport (or clicking the new "Comparar" toolbar button) calls `enterSplit(side)`; the provider then mounts `<SplitViewShell />` (`client/src/components/SplitViewShell.tsx`) which renders the origin ticket as an embedded `TicketDetailModal` on one side and a `<SpecComparePicker />` (todo-only, search, exclude-already-open) on the other. Clicking a picker card fills that side with a second embedded `TicketDetailModal`; the non-origin `×` returns the side to the picker, the origin `×` and the backdrop close all. Intra-modal navigation to a third ticket (`onOpenTicket`) collapses split and opens that ticket centered. The vertical divider between panels is a `role="separator"` with pointer-drag (clamped `[0.25, 0.75]`) and arrow-key/Home/End/0 resize. State is URL-synced as `?compare=<comparedId>&compareSide=left|right&compareOrigin=<originId>` via `useCompareUrlSync()` (`client/src/hooks/useCompareUrlSync.ts`) so refresh restores the comparison; centered-modal opens never write URL params. Viewport gating: drag, Comparar button, and split-view are all disabled below 900px (the provider auto-collapses on resize-below-threshold). **v1 limitation**: the picker uses a dedicated `SpecComparePicker` layout rather than mirroring the user's active dashboard view (list / grid / postit) — lifting `viewMode` and adding `mode='picker'` to the four dashboard view components is deferred to a follow-up change.

**Minimizable chat windows.** `MinimizedChatsProvider` (`client/src/context/MinimizedChatsContext.tsx`) lives at App root inside `HubProvider` and manages a global stack of parked chat sessions. Chips are rendered by a dedicated, always-visible `MinimizedChatsDock` (`client/src/components/minimized-chats/MinimizedChatsDock.tsx`) — a `fixed bottom-left` glass-card list the provider renders itself (NOT sonner toasts; that earlier approach was dropped because `<Toaster visibleToasts={6}>` + `duration:Infinity` silently hid the 7th+ chip and competed with transient toasts). The dock is `pointer-events-none` with `pointer-events-auto` chips at `z-[60]` so it floats above the `z-50` Explore/AI-Edit overlays — letting the user click a chip to switch sessions even while a shell is open — without blocking the overlay through the empty gutter. It reads `projects` reactively so chip project names stay live. Two surfaces opt in today: `ExploreSpecShell` (Add Spec → Explore) and `AiRefineOverlay` (Agents → AI Edit). Triggers (`SpecsBoard`, `AgentsCatalogTab`) own the shell's local state and call `provider.minimize({ kind, projectId, label, restoreRoute, params })` from the shell's minimize button. `minimize()` **dedupes by session identity** (`resumeConversationId` / `resumeRefineId`) so re-parking a session never stacks a duplicate chip, and writes `localStorage['specrails-hub:minimized-chats']` **synchronously** before returning (so an immediate refresh can't lose a just-parked chip), capped at 50.

Restore = chip click → `setActiveProjectId` → `navigate(restoreRoute)` → the chip is moved into a **persisted** pending-restore queue (`localStorage['specrails-hub:minimized-chats-pending']`) → the matching trigger consumes it via `usePendingRestore(kind, projectId, cb)` → re-mounts the shell with `resumeConversationId` (explore-spec) or `resumeRefineId` (ai-edit) so the server-side session rehydrates. **Never-lost guarantees:** (a) `pendingRestores` is persisted, so a refresh that lands between the click and the trigger mounting recovers the chip into the dock on next mount; (b) an 8s **watchdog** re-surfaces any pending restore that no trigger consumed; (c) `takePendingRestore` uses functional `setState` so concurrent restores never clobber each other. The ai-edit trigger lives inside `AgentsCatalogTab` which only mounts on the Agents `catalog` tab, so `AgentsPage` watches `pendingRestores` and auto-switches to that tab when an ai-edit restore is queued. Each parked session carries its own `projectId` (threaded through `ExploreState` / `RefineMode`) so parking on a project-switch tags the chip with the session's real project, never the live `activeProjectId`. Entries for deleted projects are dropped silently and the whole dock is hidden (chips preserved in storage, never dropped) during the setup-wizard takeover. Minimize never triggers discard-confirm — Esc / close keep their existing destructive-confirm rules.

### WebSocket protocol

Single WS connection broadcasts all messages. Every project-scoped message includes `projectId`. Client-side handlers filter by `activeProjectId`. Hub-level messages (`hub.project_added`, `hub.project_removed`, `hub.projects`) have no `projectId` and reach all handlers.

### Process spawning

`QueueManager` and `ChatManager` spawn `claude` CLI processes. Both accept a `cwd` parameter (set to `project.path` from `ProjectRegistry`) so Claude runs in the correct project directory.

### Setup wizard

When adding a project without specrails, a 5-phase wizard runs:
1. Path input (AddProjectDialog)
2. Installation proposal
3. `npx specrails-core` execution with streaming log
4. Split-view: CheckpointTracker (left) + SetupChat with Claude `/setup` (right)
5. Completion summary

Managed by `SetupManager` (server) and `SetupWizard` component (client). Hub context tracks which projects are in setup via `setupProjectIds`.

**Developer prerequisites gate.** `AddProjectDialog` and `SetupWizard` both render `<PrerequisitesPanel />` driven by the shared `usePrerequisites()` hook (60s in-memory cache, recheck on `window.focus`, manual recheck via the install-instructions modal). The hook fetches `GET /api/hub/setup-prerequisites` (server enriches the response with `platform`, `minVersion`, `meetsMinimum`, and `executable` per tool). `AddProjectDialog` disables its submit while any required tool is missing, surfaces a "More info" link only when the panel is in the missing state (suppressed in desktop mode — see below), and opens `<InstallInstructionsModal />` with OS-aware install commands (Homebrew on macOS, winget on Windows, apt/dnf on Linux) plus copy-to-clipboard. `SetupManager.startInstall` keeps `formatMissingSetupPrerequisites()` as a server-side defence-in-depth before spawning `npx specrails-core`.

**Desktop mode prerequisite check.** When `SPECRAILS_IS_DESKTOP=1`, `getSetupPrerequisitesStatus()` probes the four bundled tools (`node`, `npm`, `npx`, `git`) using absolute paths derived from `SPECRAILS_BUNDLED_RUNTIMES_PATH` (set by the Tauri host) instead of running `which` against the system PATH. **The probe is existence-gated**: only when the bundled binary file actually exists on disk does it take the bundled path — probe success → `{ bundled: true, installed: true, executable: true }`; probe failure (file present but `--version` fails) → `{ bundled: true, executable: false, error: 'corrupted-bundle', installHint: 'Bundle corrupted — reinstall the SpecRails Hub app.' }`. **When the bundled file is absent** (a build/arch that shipped no runtimes, or a partial extraction) the tool falls through to the normal system `which` probe rather than reporting `corrupted-bundle`, so a system-installed tool still satisfies the requirement instead of dead-ending Add Project with a futile "reinstall the app" message. `getBundledToolCandidates()` returns ordered candidates — Windows git accepts `git/cmd/git.exe` or `git/bin/git.exe`. Provider CLIs (`claude`, `codex`) are always probed via system PATH in all modes. On the client, `PrerequisitesPanel` renders a "Bundle corrupted — reinstall app" message and suppresses the "More info" install link when `error: 'corrupted-bundle'` is present. `InstallInstructionsModal` shows a simplified error panel (no OS install commands) as defence-in-depth. `PathSource` type includes `'bundled'` for diagnostic segments prepended from the runtimes directory.

**GUI-launch PATH resolution (`server/path-resolver.ts`).** When the desktop app is launched from Finder/Dock, the embedded server inherits the launchd `PATH` which on Apple Silicon does not include `/opt/homebrew/bin`. There are two execution paths:

- **Desktop mode** (`SPECRAILS_IS_DESKTOP=1`, set by Tauri host): `resolveStartupPath()` existence-gates each candidate and prepends only the bundled Node and Git bin directories from `SPECRAILS_BUNDLED_RUNTIMES_PATH` that **exist on disk** as the first PATH entries (tagged `'bundled'` in the diagnostic). When at least one bundled dir is prepended the homebrew/fast-path prepend is skipped and `augmentPathFromLoginShell()` is a no-op (`loginShellStatus: 'skipped'`) — this prevents any login-shell output from prepending system node/git ahead of the bundled ones (tracked via the module-level `bundledRuntimesActive` flag). **When no bundled dir exists** (runtimes-less build / partial extraction), `resolveStartupPath()` does NOT early-return — it falls through to the normal system discovery (fast-path prepend + login-shell augmentation) so system node/git still resolve, exactly mirroring the prerequisite check's existence-fallback. `resolveBundledRuntimePath()` is an exported helper that returns `SPECRAILS_BUNDLED_RUNTIMES_PATH` or throws if unset.

- **Non-desktop mode** (`npm run dev:server`, Docker, etc.): `resolveStartupPath()` prepends missing well-known package-manager directories (`/opt/homebrew/{bin,sbin}`, `/usr/local/{bin,sbin}` on macOS; `/usr/local/{bin,sbin}`, `~/.local/bin` on Linux; no-op on Windows). `augmentPathFromLoginShell()` (async, 1500ms timeout) merges additional segments from the user's `$SHELL -l -i` rc files (Volta/nvm/fnm/asdf shims).

The resolved `PATH` is written to `process.env.PATH`, so all downstream spawns (`QueueManager`, `ChatManager`, `SetupManager`, `terminalManager`) inherit it without per-callsite changes. The setup-prerequisites response distinguishes `installed` (on PATH) from `executable` (`<cmd> --version` exited 0), surfacing a broken-symlink hint when `installed && !executable`. `GET /api/hub/setup-prerequisites?diagnostic=1` returns the resolved PATH, per-segment source (`'inherited' | 'fast-path' | 'login-shell' | 'bundled'`), login-shell status, and per-tool results, used by the "Copy diagnostics" button in the install-instructions modal.

**Bundled runtimes (desktop capability).** The Tauri host (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) sets `SPECRAILS_IS_DESKTOP=1` and `SPECRAILS_BUNDLED_RUNTIMES_PATH=<resource_dir>/runtimes` before spawning the Node.js sidecar — **but only when the `runtimes/` dir exists and is non-empty** (a build that ships no runtimes runs as a normal server and falls back to system PATH, never dead-ending on "corrupted-bundle"). The `runtimes/` directory (under `src-tauri/` at build time, under `Contents/Resources/` or `resources/` in the bundle) is populated by CI before `tauri build` runs, for macOS arm64, Windows x64, and Windows arm64. Its layout: `runtimes/node/bin/{node,npm,npx}` on macOS/Linux, `runtimes/node/{node.exe,npm.cmd,npx.cmd}` on Windows; `runtimes/git/bin/git` on macOS/Linux, `runtimes/git/cmd/git.exe` on Windows. `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` includes `"runtimes/**/*"` in `bundle.resources` (array/glob form — preserves nested directory structure) so Tauri copies the directory into the app bundle. The `src-tauri/runtimes/` directory is gitignored (only a `.gitkeep` placeholder is tracked). **Non-desktop mode is completely unaffected** — `SPECRAILS_IS_DESKTOP` is never set outside the Tauri host.

**How CI assembles the runtimes (`.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`).** Tauri's resource bundler **dereferences symlinks** (tauri-apps/tauri#13219), does **not** reliably preserve exec bits, and does **not** codesign `bundle.resources` binaries — so the runtimes are prepared to survive all three:
- **Node** is downloaded from nodejs.org (SHA256-verified against `SHASUMS256.txt`). On macOS/Linux the `bin/npm` and `bin/npx` relative symlinks are **replaced with POSIX wrapper scripts** (`exec "$DIR/node" "$DIR/../lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js" "$@"`) — plain text survives bundling and always invokes the bundled node. On Windows `npm.cmd`/`npx.cmd` are kept as-is (they resolve the adjacent `node.exe` via `%~dp0`).
- **Git on macOS is built from source** (kernel.org tarball, SHA256-pinned) with `RUNTIME_PREFIX=YesPlease NO_GETTEXT=1 NO_OPENSSL=1 APPLE_COMMON_CRYPTO=1` and no `USE_LIBPCRE2` → a relocatable tree (`bin/git` + `libexec/git-core` + `share/git-core/templates`) whose only dylib deps are macOS **system** libs (asserted via `otool -L`), so no `install_name_tool` relocation is needed. The builtin hardlinks under `libexec/git-core` are collapsed (git dispatches builtins internally). **Git on Windows** is the SHA256-verified Git-for-Windows PortableGit (`-64-bit` / `-arm64`) self-extracted to `runtimes/git/`.
- **macOS codesigning**: a dedicated CI step signs every Mach-O under `runtimes/` with hardened runtime + `entitlements.plist` (JIT for V8) **before** `tauri build`, so the assembled `.app` notarizes cleanly (signatures embed in the Mach-O and survive Tauri's copy). `scripts/fix-desktop-bundle.mjs` is intentionally **not** wired into `build:desktop` — running it post-`tauri build` would re-sign after notarization and invalidate the updater `.app.tar.gz`.
- **Smoke tests** validate both the staging `src-tauri/runtimes/` copy and the copy **inside the assembled `.app`** (macOS), running `node`/`npm`/`npx --version` (bundled node prepended to a scrubbed PATH) and a functional `git init`+`commit`+`log` (via `scripts/smoke-bundled-runtimes.sh`) that would catch a missing `git-core` helper, a broken dylib, a dereferenced symlink, or a dropped exec bit. Windows jobs run the equivalent in PowerShell.

**Env vars contract (desktop mode only):**
- `SPECRAILS_IS_DESKTOP=1` — set by Tauri host **iff** the bundled `runtimes/` dir is present and non-empty; gates all desktop-mode branches
- `SPECRAILS_BUNDLED_RUNTIMES_PATH=<abs path>` — set by Tauri host alongside the flag; absolute path to the `runtimes/` directory inside the app bundle

**Install flow.** The hub ships a single install flow — template agents that are ready in seconds. The wizard has three steps (`Configure` / `Install` / `Done`) and no tier selector. Internally the client still sends `tier: 'quick'` in the `install-config.yaml` payload because `specrails-core` parses that field; the field is hardcoded and not user-selectable. The legacy AI-enriched flow (codebase analysis + persona generation) is intentionally not exposed in the hub — users who want it can run `npx specrails-core@latest init` from the project directory. Server code under `server/setup-manager.ts` retains the `'quick' | 'full'` plumbing for forward compatibility but is currently driven into the quick branch only.

### Agent profiles (Agents section)

Per-project catalog of agent profiles — declarative JSON that tells the implement pipeline which agents to run, which models to use per agent, and how to route tasks. Profiles are selected per rail at launch time (snapshot-per-job) so concurrent rails in the same batch can run distinct profiles. Requires `specrails-core >= 4.1.0` in the project; otherwise the hub gracefully falls back to legacy behavior (no env injection).

**Server (`server/profile-manager.ts`)**: CRUD over `<project>/.specrails/profiles/*.json` with `ajv` v1 schema validation (`server/schemas/profile.v1.json`, a copy of the specrails-core schema). Structural checks beyond JSON Schema: exactly one terminal `default: true` routing rule and it must be last; baseline trio (`sr-architect`, `sr-developer`, `sr-reviewer`) must be present in `agents[]`. Resolution order at launch: explicit selection → `.user-preferred.json` (gitignored) → `default` profile. `snapshotForJob` writes the resolved profile to `~/.specrails/projects/<slug>/jobs/<jobId>/profile.json` (chmod 400) before spawn. `persistJobProfile` inserts into `job_profiles` for analytics.

**REST surface (`server/profiles-router.ts`)** mounted at `/api/projects/:projectId/profiles`, gated by `SPECRAILS_AGENTS_SECTION !== 'false'`: list/get/create/update/delete/duplicate/rename profiles; `/active` for the per-developer preference; `/resolve?profile=…` to preview resolution; `/catalog` and `/catalog/:agentId` for the agents catalog viewer; `/core-version` for the upgrade banner; `/analytics?windowDays=30` for per-profile metrics; `/migrate-from-settings` to seed `default.json` from existing frontmatter models.

**QueueManager integration (`server/queue-manager.ts`)**: `EnqueueOptions` accepts `profileName` (string = explicit, null = force legacy, undefined = default resolution). At spawn time `projectSupportsProfiles(cwd)` checks `.specrails/specrails-version` (gate: `>= 4.1.0`); when allowed, profile resolved + snapshotted + persisted + env var `SPECRAILS_PROFILE_PATH` injected. OTEL resource attrs include `specrails.profile_name` and `specrails.profile_schema_version` when profile mode is active.

**Client (`client/src/pages/AgentsPage.tsx`)**: `/agents` route under ProjectLayout, reached from the right sidebar. Two tabs: **Profiles** (full CRUD + agent chain editor with catalog picker + routing rules editor + per-profile analytics card) and **Agents Catalog** (read-only viewer of upstream and custom agents). Yellow banner at the top when the project's core version is below 4.1.0. Profile selection at launch happens in the rail header via `RailProfileSelector` and is sent as `profileName` on the rails launch API (`POST /rails/:i/launch`, or `PUT /rails/:i/profile` to persist). NOTE: the standalone `ImplementWizard`/`BatchImplementWizard` dialogs from the original profiles PR (#246) were superseded by the rail-header flow and have been deleted (along with their `IssuePickerStep`/`ProfilePicker` helpers).

**Reserved paths (contract with specrails-core)**: `.specrails/profiles/**` and `.claude/agents/custom-*.md` are never touched by specrails-core's `init` / `update` commands (Node-native from v4.2.0, bash `install.sh`/`update.sh` before). Profiles are committable team assets; `.user-preferred.json` inside `.specrails/profiles/` is auto-gitignored on first write.

### Terminal panel

Per-project bottom terminal panel (VSCode/Cursor style) gated by `FEATURE_TERMINAL_PANEL` (set `VITE_FEATURE_TERMINAL_PANEL=true` to enable in the client). Server gate: `SPECRAILS_TERMINAL_PANEL !== 'false'` (default on).

**Server (`server/terminal-manager.ts`)**: singleton `TerminalManager` owns all PTY sessions via `node-pty`. Each session keeps a 256 KB ring buffer of raw output, a set of attached WebSocket clients, and a stored `projectId`. Shells are spawned with `$SHELL -l -i` on POSIX (so `.zshrc` / `.bashrc` load) or `powershell.exe -NoLogo` on Windows, with `TERM=xterm-256color` + `COLORTERM=truecolor` and `cwd = project.path`. Hard cap of 10 sessions per project. REST endpoints under `/api/projects/:projectId/terminals` (GET list, POST create, PATCH rename, DELETE kill). PTY streaming uses a dedicated WebSocket `/ws/terminal/:id?token=...&projectId=...` — NOT the shared `/ws` — so terminal throughput cannot starve the project event stream. Attach protocol: `<scrollback binary>` → `{type:"ready",cols,rows}` JSON → live binary frames. Project removal via `ProjectRegistry.removeProject` calls `killAllForProject(id)`; graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT) runs `terminalManager.shutdown()` (SIGTERM, 2s grace, SIGKILL).

**Client (`client/src/context/TerminalsContext.tsx`)**: per-project state (`visibility: hidden|restored|maximized`, `userHeight`, `sessions`, `activeId`) lives in a single provider mounted above the route outlet so it survives project switches. Key invariant: xterm.js `Terminal` instances are created once per session and NEVER unmounted until kill — each session's container div is attached to a hidden `<div id="specrails-terminal-host">` appended to `document.body`. The `TerminalViewport` component `appendChild`s the active session's container into its own subtree on mount and moves it back on unmount (survives StrictMode double-invoke). Panel visibility + `userHeight` persisted per-project to `localStorage` under `specrails-hub:terminal-panel:<projectId>`. `Cmd+J` / `Ctrl+J` toggles the panel (guarded against `[role="dialog"]`) and focuses the active xterm on open. Minimize (panel chevron + StatusBar chevron at pixel-identical offset, both using `PanelChevronButton`) does NOT kill PTYs; close (trash icon + per-terminal `✕`) kills directly with no confirmation.

**Desktop packaging (`scripts/build-sidecar.mjs`)**: `node-pty` is marked external in esbuild, and its full package directory is copied to `src-tauri/binaries/node-pty/` (so `spawn-helper` resolves on real filesystem instead of inside the pkg snapshot). The prebuilt `pty.node` is also copied to `src-tauri/binaries/pty.node` as a `dlopen` target. The `Module._resolveFilename` / `_load` and `process.dlopen` patches at the top of `server/index.ts` redirect `require('node-pty')` to a `createRequire`-based loader anchored at the externally extracted path. The shell-integration shims (`server/shell-integration/{zsh,bash,fish,powershell}-shim.*`) are also copied to `src-tauri/binaries/shell-integration/` so the runtime resolver in `server/terminal-shell-integration.ts` can locate them via `path.resolve(process.execPath, '..', 'shell-integration', name)`. `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` triggers codesigning of `pty.node` + `spawn-helper` (hardened runtime + entitlements for the helper) for notarization.

**Premium-panel features (post `add-premium-terminal-panel`)**: the panel layers WebGL rendering (with canvas fallback on context loss), Unicode 11 widths, ligatures, scrollback search (Cmd+F), font zoom (Cmd+= / -/0), Cmd+C/V/K clipboard keybindings, right-click context menu, drag-drop file path injection (Tauri only, POSIX/Windows shell-quoted), trailing-debounced resize + sidebar transitionend hook for jitter-free animation, and a shell-integration layer based on OSC 133 / OSC 1337 marks. The `TerminalManager` injects per-shell shims (`ZDOTDIR` for zsh, `--rcfile` for bash, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` for fish, `-NoLogo -NoExit -File` for PowerShell) chmod-600 under `~/.specrails/projects/<slug>/terminals/<sessionId>/`, parses inbound OSC streams server-side via `OscParser`, broadcasts JSON `{type:"mark",kind,...}` control frames on the existing `/ws/terminal/:id` socket, persists completed commands to `terminal_command_marks` (FIFO-capped at 1000 per session), and cleans up shim dirs on session kill plus a 24h-stale sweep at startup. Settings live in `hub_settings` (key/value, hub-wide) and `terminal_settings_override` per-project; resolution order is project override → hub default → built-in. REST: `GET/PATCH /api/hub/terminal-settings`, `GET/PATCH /api/projects/:projectId/terminal-settings`, `GET /api/projects/:projectId/terminals/:id/marks`. Inline images via `@xterm/addon-image` (Sixel + iTerm2 protocol) and long-running command notifications via the Tauri notification plugin (with browser HTML5 `Notification` fallback) round out the differentiator surface. Disabled-by-default behaviours degrade silently when integrations fail (sentinel-not-seen toast informs the user).

### Multi-provider architecture

The hub supports both Claude Code and Codex CLI as first-class providers via a `ProviderAdapter` contract. Every manager that spawns an AI CLI (`ChatManager`, `QueueManager`, `AgentRefineManager`, `SetupManager`, `project-router /tickets/generate-spec`) consumes the adapter — never branches on `provider === 'X'`.

The contract lives at `server/providers/types.ts`. Adapter implementations: `server/providers/claude-adapter.ts` (full native support — `nativeResume`, `nativeStreamJson`, `nativeCostUsd`, `nativeOtelEnv`, `systemPromptArg` all true) and `server/providers/codex-adapter.ts` (codex 0.128.0+ with `nativeCostUsd: false` and `nativeOtelEnv: false`). The registry at `server/providers/registry.ts` is populated by `server/providers/index.ts` at module load; managers resolve via `getAdapter(project.provider)`.

Key cross-cutting modules: `server/pricing.ts` (rate-card fallback for providers without native cost), `server/codex-otel-bridge.ts` (synthetic OTEL spans/metrics/logs for non-native-OTEL providers — feeds the same OTLP receiver claude does), `server/result-event.ts` `finaliseInvocationResult` (one entry point per close handler combining `adapter.extractResult` + pricing fallback). Plugins are provider-aware too: `server/plugins/codex-mcp.ts` for the `codex mcp add/remove/list` integration with per-project `CODEX_HOME=~/.specrails/projects/<slug>/codex-home/`; contributors target `adapter.instructionsFilename` (CLAUDE.md vs AGENTS.md) instead of hardcoding.

User-facing docs: `docs/codex.md`. Developer guide for adding a third provider (one file + one registry entry): `docs/adding-a-provider.md`.

Emergency rollback for the codex path: `SPECRAILS_HUB_CODEX_BETA=0` in the hub env. Default unset / `1` means codex is enabled.

### Multi-provider per project

A project can install **both** providers at once. The data model keeps the existing `provider` column as the **primary/default** and adds a `providers` JSON-array column (`projects.providers`, hub migration 10; self-healed by migration 11 — an earlier WIP burned version 10 with `installed_engines`/`default_engine` columns, so 11 adds `providers` if missing and backfills). `getProject` parses it via `mapProjectRow`; `ProjectRow.providers` always contains at least `provider`. **Invariant: when `providers.length === 1` every surface behaves byte-identically to a single-provider project** — selectors don't render, no provider is persisted, no override is sent.

**Per-invocation provider (late binding).** Managers keep their primary adapter and resolve a per-call adapter via `getAdapter(requested)` with fallback to primary: `QueueManager._resolveJobAdapter(jobId)` (per-job, from `EnqueueOptions.provider`, consumed once from `_jobProviderSelection`; threaded through the entire `_startJob` + `_onJobExit(…, adapter)` so binary/argv/model/profile/OTEL/plugins/`parseStreamLine`/`finaliseInvocationResult`/`ai_invocations.provider` all use it), and `ChatManager._adapterForConversation(conversation)` (from `chat_conversations.provider`, db migration 24/self-healed by 26). The shared resolver/validator lives in `server/provider-selection.ts` (`resolveProvider`, `validateRequestedProvider`, `isProviderEnabled`, `isMultiProvider` — all tolerant of a row missing `providers`).

**Routes** accept an optional `aiEngine` (alias `provider`) validated against the project's installed providers (`POST /spawn`, `POST /chat/conversations`, `POST /tickets/generate-spec`, rails `POST /:i/launch` + new `PUT /:i/engine`); `GET /default-spec-model?provider=` returns that engine's catalog + the `providers` list. `POST /api/hub/projects` accepts `providers: string[]` (deduped, first = primary; legacy single `provider` still honoured). `chat_conversations.provider` is persisted only on multi-provider projects (else NULL = legacy). Rails store an `ai_engine` per rail (`rails.ai_engine`, db migration 25); codex rails force-`null` the profile (codex has no agent profiles). Contract Refine is skipped when the conversation's provider isn't claude (Claude-only feature).

**Capability intersection.** When >1 provider is installed the right sidebar shows only sections **every** installed provider supports — `client/src/lib/provider-capabilities.ts` `sectionVisibleForProviders(section, providers)` hides Agents (profiles) + Integrations (plugins) because Codex has no equivalent; Add Spec hides SMASH/Contract-Layer for the selected/intersected engine. Single-provider projects are unaffected (intersection of one set is that set).

**Client UI (all gated on `providers.length > 1`).** `AddProjectDialog` multi-selects providers (checkboxes, defaults to all available). `SetupWizard` becomes a per-provider configure flow: one Configure step per provider → a single Install step that runs each provider's `npx specrails-core` install **sequentially** (client-orchestrated; the server's per-provider `startQuickInstall` + `setup_install_done.summary.provider` are reused unchanged) → a Done step with per-provider summary cards. `AiEngineSelector` (Add Spec), `RailEngineSelector` (rail header), and the terminal `CliLaunchMenu` (the "Open AI CLI" Sparkles button opens a provider picker) let the user pick per-invocation. `AnalyticsPage` adds engine filter chips (`?provider=` → `spending.ts` `buildWhere` `COALESCE(provider,'claude') IN (…)`). The selected engine is remembered per project via `client/src/lib/last-engine.ts` (default = primary). Provider selection is **immutable after creation** (v1 — no Settings mutation).

## Coverage policy (MANDATORY)

CI enforces coverage thresholds: **70% global** (lines/functions/statements) and **80% server** (lines/functions/statements, 70% branches), plus **80% client** (lines/statements, 70% functions). If the local run fails any of these thresholds, you MUST iterate — write more tests — until every threshold passes locally before pushing or asking the user. Never lower the thresholds. Never propose lowering as a fix. The exact commands to mirror CI:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:coverage              # server, must pass 80% lines/functions/statements
cd client && npm run test:coverage # client, must pass 80% lines/statements
```

Excluding files from coverage is allowed only when the file is structurally unreachable in the test environment (e.g. Tauri-only paths in jsdom) — never to mask missing tests. If you exclude, document the reason inline in `client/vitest.config.ts` / `vitest.config.ts` next to the entry.

## Conventions

- **File naming**: kebab-case for server/CLI, PascalCase for React components
- **State per project**: never use module-level caches that bleed between projects. Use `useProjectCache` or per-project Maps in refs.
- **API calls**: always use `getApiBase()` prefix, never hardcode `/api/...`
- **WS handlers**: always filter `msg.projectId` against active project via ref (not stale closure)
- **Settings**: hub settings = modal (`GlobalSettingsPage`), project settings = route (`SettingsPage`)
- **Chat**: sidebar panel in `ProjectLayout`, not a separate page

## Ports

- `4200` — Express server (API + WebSocket)
- `4201` — Vite dev server (proxies `/api` and `/hooks` to 4200)

## Release pipeline

Releases are automated via release-please + GitHub Actions:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — runs `typecheck` + `vitest` + coverage enforcement on every push and PR. Coverage thresholds are hard gates: **70% global** (lines/functions/statements) and **80% server** (lines/functions/statements, 70% branches). CI fails if thresholds are not met.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — on every push to `main`:
  - release-please creates/updates a Release PR (bumps version in `package.json` + `CHANGELOG.md`)
  - When the Release PR is merged, release-please creates the GitHub Release and `npm publish` runs automatically
  - Publishes with **npm provenance attestation** (`--provenance --access public`) for SLSA Level 2 supply chain security. Requires `id-token: write` permission in the workflow.
- **Desktop Release** (`.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`) — on every `v*` tag push or manual dispatch:
  - Runs two build jobs in parallel:
    - `build-macos` on `macos-latest`: signed + notarised Apple Silicon `.dmg`.
    - `build-windows` on `windows-latest`: **unsigned** NSIS `.exe` installer and MSI. v1 ships without Authenticode signing on purpose — users see a SmartScreen warning and must click "More info → Run anyway". Code signing is a separate follow-up change. See `docs/windows.md`.
  - Canonical installer filenames, enforced by a rename step in `deploy`:
    - `specrails-hub-<version>-aarch64.dmg`
    - `specrails-hub-<version>-x64-setup.exe` (NSIS)
    - `specrails-hub-<version>-x64.msi`
  - FTP-uploads every installer to Hostinger under two paths: the archival versioned folder `downloads/specrails-hub/v<version>/` and the stable `downloads/specrails-hub/latest/` channel.
  - Writes a machine-readable `manifest.json` into `latest/` describing the release (schemaVersion, version, releasedAt, releaseUrl, `platforms.darwin-arm64` and `platforms.windows-x64`, each with filename/url/sha256/size). The `windows-x64` entry points at the NSIS `.exe`; the MSI is reachable via the versioned folder but is NOT referenced by manifest. Consumers like specrails-web read this to render Download CTAs without hardcoding versions.
  - Ordering: every installer referenced by the manifest (`.dmg`, `.exe`) is uploaded AND HEAD-verified before `manifest.json` is uploaded. A consumer that sees the new manifest must always find the referenced binary, for every platform.
  - **Server-side one-time setup**: the Hostinger `latest/` folder contains a hand-authored `.htaccess` that sets `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on `manifest.json`. This file is server-managed, not in the repo — do not add workflow steps that wipe `latest/` wholesale. The `Delete stale installers in latest/` step only removes `.dmg|.exe|.msi` files. See the inline comment in `desktop-release.yml` for the `.htaccess` contents.

Commit message prefixes that affect versioning: `feat:` → minor, `fix:` → patch, `feat!:` → major. Commits without a conventional prefix are ignored by release-please.

### Plugin system (Integrations)

Per-project marketplace of MCP-based integrations. Each project independently decides which plugins to install. v1 ships **bundled-only**: every plugin available is compiled into the hub binary; there is no remote registry, no user-installable plugins, and no third-party loading. **Zero changes are required in `specrails-core`** — plugins only contribute MCP server entries (via `.mcp.json`) and optionally a fragment in the already-protected `.claude/agents/custom-*.md` namespace.

**Additivity is the central invariant.** Adding plugin N+1 must never mutate any artifact owned by plugin N or by the user. Each plugin's manifest declares `owns.mcpServers` / `owns.agentFragments`; ownership conflicts are detected at hub startup (`buildOwnershipMap`) and fail fast. All file mutations (`.mcp.json`, `state.json`) are surgical (read → modify only owned keys → atomic temp+rename) and serialised by an in-process file mutex.

**Server (`server/plugin-manager.ts` + `server/plugins/`)**: `PluginManager` owns the lifecycle: `listAvailable`, `previewInstall`, `install` (with rollback on verify failure), `uninstall`, `verify` (timeout-bounded, default 2000ms), `removeOrphan`. State lives at `<project>/.specrails/plugins/state.json` (`{ schemaVersion: 1, plugins: { [name]: { version, installedAt, installedFiles, health, healthReason } } }`). `BUNDLED_PLUGINS` is a typed array in `server/plugins/index.ts` — registering a new plugin requires only appending an import. Helpers `PluginManager.mergeMcpServers` / `removeMcpServers` are the only sanctioned way to mutate `.mcp.json`.

**REST (`server/plugins-router.ts`)** mounted at `/api/projects/:projectId/plugins`, gated by `SPECRAILS_PLUGINS_SECTION !== 'false'`: `GET /` (catalog with status `installed | not-installed | orphan | degraded`), `GET /:name/preview-install` (diff before mutation), `POST /:name/install` (with WS streaming progress via `plugin.install_progress`), `DELETE /:name` (uninstall or orphan removal), `GET /:name/health` (on-demand verify).

**WS events**: `plugin.installed`, `plugin.uninstalled`, `plugin.health_changed`, `plugin.degraded`, `plugin.install_progress` — all `projectId`-scoped.

**Rail integration (`server/queue-manager.ts` + `server/plugins/rail-integration.ts`)**: before spawning a `claude` rail process, `QueueManager` resolves installed plugins (parallel verify with per-plugin timeout), classifies into `active` and `degraded`, and writes a per-job snapshot to `~/.specrails/projects/<slug>/jobs/<jobId>/plugins.json` (chmod 400). It injects env vars `SPECRAILS_PLUGINS_ACTIVE` (CSV) and `SPECRAILS_PLUGINS_SNAPSHOT` (path). When pipeline telemetry is enabled, OTEL resource attrs include `specrails.plugins.active`, `specrails.plugins.degraded`, and `specrails.plugins.versions`. **Healthcheck failure is non-blocking** — degraded plugins emit `plugin.degraded` but the rail spawns normally. `ChatManager` inherits MCP config via `cwd` (no snapshot, no env injection); `SetupManager` ignores plugins entirely (project under construction).

**Diagnostic export (`server/telemetry-export.ts`)**: includes `plugins.json` in the ZIP and a "Plugins" section in `summary.md` whenever a per-job plugin snapshot exists.

**Bundled today**: `serena` (semantic code navigation via LSP+MCP). Manifest in `server/plugins/serena/manifest.ts`; install adds `mcpServers.serena` running `uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena ...`; verify probes `uvx serena --version`. The optional `templates/instructions.md` fragment lands at `<project>/.claude/agents/custom-serena.md`. Requires `uv` on PATH (auto-detected by an extended `setup-prerequisites.ts` with `includeUv: true`).

**Reserved paths (per-project, hub-managed)**: `<project>/.mcp.json` (surgical merge), `<project>/.specrails/plugins/state.json`, `<project>/.specrails/plugins/snapshots/<jobId>.json`, `<project>/.claude/agents/custom-<plugin>.md`. Hub never wholesale rewrites any of these.

### Theme system

Hub-wide UI theme selectable from `GlobalSettingsPage > Appearance`. Three built-ins: `dracula` (default), `aurora-light`, `obsidian-dark`. Persisted hub-wide as `hub_settings.ui_theme` (server) and mirrored to `localStorage['specrails-hub:ui-theme']` (client) with an inline anti-FOUC script in `client/index.html` that applies `data-theme` on `<html>` before React hydrates.

**Token contract**: components MUST use semantic Tailwind tokens (`accent-primary`, `accent-info`, `accent-success`, `accent-secondary`, `accent-warning`, `accent-highlight`, `surface`, `background-deep`, plus the shadcn-style `background`/`foreground`/`card`/`muted`/`destructive`). Brand-named tokens (`dracula-*`) are forbidden — a regression guard greps for them. Adding a fourth theme requires only (a) appending a descriptor to `client/src/lib/themes.ts`, (b) a new `[data-theme="<id>"] { ... }` block in `client/src/globals.css`, and (c) extending the allow-list in both `THEME_IDS` and `server/hub-router.ts`. No component-code changes.

**Non-CSS surfaces** (xterm, Recharts, syntax highlighting) read the active theme via `useActiveTheme()` (gracefully falls back to `getActiveTheme()` when no `<ThemeProvider>` is mounted, so unit tests don't need provider wrapping). xterm instances reconfigure live (`term.options.theme = ...`) without losing scrollback or shell-integration state.

**REST**: `GET /api/hub/theme` returns `{ theme }`; `PATCH /api/hub/theme` validates the body against the allow-list and returns 400 on rejection.

### Draft tickets (Save as Draft)

In-progress Explore Spec sessions can be persisted as **draft tickets** so the user can resume an exploration later from the SpecsBoard.

**Schema (`server/ticket-store.ts`)**: `TicketStatus` includes `'draft'`; `Ticket.priority` is widened to `TicketPriority | null`; `Ticket.origin_conversation_id: string | null` links the Explore conversation. The JSON store's `schema_version` bumps from `'1.0'` to `'1.1'` on first write under this code; old stores remain readable (the read path normalizes missing `origin_conversation_id` to `null`). `validatePriorityForStatus(status, priority)` is the single source of truth: priority MAY be null only when `status === 'draft'`.

**Server endpoints (`server/project-router.ts`)**:
- `POST /tickets/save-as-draft` — persists an Explore session as a draft. Body: `{ conversationId, title?, description?, labels? }`. Rejects when the conversation has no user-submitted turn. Idempotent on `conversationId`: a second save updates the existing draft instead of inserting a duplicate. Auto-title via `server/explore-draft-title.ts` when no title is provided (deterministic single-line summary; LLM enrichment is the documented extension point).
- `POST /tickets/from-draft` — extended with a flip-in-place path: when the body carries `draftTicketId` (or just `conversationId` matching an existing draft's `origin_conversation_id`), the server flips the existing row (`status: 'draft' → 'todo'`, sets `priority`, replaces title/description, preserves `origin_conversation_id`) and broadcasts `ticket_updated`. Legacy non-draft path (no draft match) still inserts a new row and broadcasts `ticket_created`.
- `DELETE /tickets/:id` — when the deleted ticket is a draft and is the only ticket referencing its `origin_conversation_id`, the linked `chat_conversations` row (kind `'explore'`) is cascade-deleted.
- `DELETE /chat/conversations/:id` — sweeps tickets whose `origin_conversation_id` matches and clears the field to `null` (application-level "ON DELETE SET NULL").

**Client surfaces**:
- `ExploreSpecShell` exposes a `Save as Draft` button (disabled until at least one user-submitted turn) and replaces the destructive close confirm with a three-way `Save as Draft / Discard / Cancel` prompt (Save is default-focused). The minimize-to-toast path is unchanged.
- `SpecCard`, `TicketListView`, `TicketGridView`, `TicketPostItView`, and `TicketStatusIndicator` render a draft visual variant: subtle `accent-secondary` background/border (semantic theme tokens, no brand-named colours) and a `Draft` pill in the priority pill's DOM slot. Drafts live in the existing Backlog column — no new column, no filter chip, no collapsible section.
- `TicketDetailModal` shows a `Continue Explore` action when `status === 'draft'` and `origin_conversation_id` is non-null. Activating it calls `MinimizedChatsContext.triggerResume(...)` to navigate + queue a pending-restore that `ExploreSpecShell` consumes via `usePendingRestore`. The ticket stays `status='draft'` during the resumed session.

**Lifecycle**: drafts are never auto-deleted. They disappear only on explicit Discard or when committed to a non-draft status. `from-draft` flip preserves `origin_conversation_id` permanently for future "View origin conversation" UI.

**Out of scope** (deferred): concurrency lock when two tabs edit the same draft (last-write-wins for now), and surfacing `origin_conversation_id` on committed tickets as a UI affordance.

### Explore Spec acceleration

The Explore Spec chat ships a multi-pronged latency optimisation so that first-token feels electric without compromising spec quality.

**Hub-managed cwd (`server/explore-cwd-manager.ts`):** Explore turns spawn `claude` from `~/.specrails/projects/<slug>/explore-cwd/` rather than the project path, so the project's `CLAUDE.md` (often huge) is not auto-loaded by the CLI. The dir contains a hub-owned embedded `CLAUDE.md` (~50 lines, focused on the Explore-Spec stance) and a `./project` symlink (junction on Windows; `project-path.txt` fallback if both fail) pointing at `<project.path>`. Tools (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`) keep working against the user's repo via that link. The user's `<project>/CLAUDE.md` is never modified, moved, or referenced — only the link target is.

**MCP scope is per-spec.** The decision is recorded on `chat_conversations.context_scope.mcp` at conversation creation time (via the Add Spec modal's `Project MCPs` toggle / preset slider). When `true` the spawn cwd is `<project.path>` so `.mcp.json` loads; when `false`/missing the spawn uses the hub-managed `explore-cwd/`. There is no project-level default and no Settings UI — the choice lives with the ticket forever via `origin_conversation_id`.

**User-approved MCPs are a SEPARATE per-spec toggle (`context_scope.userMcp`).** The `mcp` flag above loads the project-committed `.mcp.json`; `userMcp` loads the user's OWN already-approved MCP servers — the ones registered locally with `claude mcp add` / `codex mcp add` — independent of `mcp` and WITHOUT changing the spawn cwd (so the explore-cwd latency win is preserved). Surfaced as the Fine-tune checkbox `My approved MCPs` (Explore-only, disabled in Quick; not part of any slider preset). Server: `server/user-mcp-config.ts` `buildUserMcpArgs()` — for claude it reads `~/.claude.json` (user-scope top-level `mcpServers` merged with `projects[<projectPath>].mcpServers` local-scope, local wins on conflict), writes a chmod-600 `~/.specrails/projects/<slug>/user-mcp.json`, and appends `--mcp-config <file>` to the spawn argv. The CLI loads `--mcp-config` additively (no `--strict-mcp-config`), and the existing `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in `COMMON_FLAGS` (`server/providers/claude-adapter.ts`) means the `mcp__*` tools are callable — the `--tools Read,Grep,Glob` whitelist gates built-in tools only, NOT MCP tools (verified e2e against claude 2.1.169). For codex `buildUserMcpArgs` returns `[]`: codex chat turns spawn with `env: process.env` and no `CODEX_HOME` override, so codex already reads the user's global `~/.codex/config.toml` MCP servers natively. Wired in `ChatManager.sendMessage` next to `toolFlagsForScope`.

**Byte-stable system prompt:** `ChatManager._buildLightweightSystemPrompt()` is deterministic — no timestamps, costs, or live aggregates — so Anthropic prompt cache hits on turns 2+ within the 5-minute TTL window. The non-Explore `_buildSystemPrompt()` retains its live dashboard context unchanged.

**Lifecycle (`ChatManager._exploreLifecycle`):** Per-Explore-conversation state with three policies:
- **Idle-kill on minimize:** `POST /api/projects/:projectId/chat/conversations/:id/minimize` arms a 2-minute idle timer; if no message and no restore in that window, any active spawn is `treeKill`ed (SIGTERM). The conversation row's `session_id` is preserved; the next message respawns with `--resume`. `POST .../restore` cancels the timer. The timer only arms when the conversation is not currently streaming.
- **Crash auto-respawn:** if the child exits non-zero before emitting a `result` event and the user did not interrupt, the same turn respawns once with `--resume`. The crash counter resets on any successful turn. A second crash surfaces `chat_error`.
- **Concurrency cap of 5 per project:** the sixth Explore turn evicts the oldest idle Explore spawn; if all five are streaming, the new turn queues with a 30-second timeout and then emits `chat_error reason='busy'` if no slot opens.

**Premium UX (`client/src/components/explore-spec/ExploreStatusPills.tsx`):** Status pills `Conectando… → Pensando… → Consultando código…` are rendered above the streaming assistant bubble for the first few hundred ms of every turn, gated by `VITE_FEATURE_EXPLORE_PREMIUM_UX !== 'false'` for an emergency disable. Each pill displays for at least 150 ms to avoid flicker. The pill area unmounts as soon as the first text delta arrives.

**Escape hatches:** `SPECRAILS_EXPLORE_LEGACY_CWD=1` (server env) forces every Explore spawn to use `<project.path>` and skips materialising the explore-cwd entirely. `VITE_FEATURE_EXPLORE_PREMIUM_UX=false` (client build flag) reverts the status pills to a pre-change rendering. Both keep Explore functional and lose no data.

**Cleanup:** `ProjectRegistry.removeProject` calls `removeExploreCwd(slug)` which recursively rms the explore-cwd directory (the `./project` symlink is `unlink`ed explicitly, never followed). Any active Explore spawns are independently torn down.

**Out of scope** (deferred): true persistent stdin multi-turn (`claude --input-format stream-json` keeping a single child alive across turns), char-by-char client-side rendering buffer, skeleton-on-submit assistant bubble, per-project user-customizable `<project>/.specrails/explore-instructions.md` override, sidebar-chat (`kind='sidebar'`) cache-busting fix, and Quick-mode acceleration. These remain future-change candidates.

### Project spending analytics

Per-project unified tracking of every billable AI CLI invocation (model, tokens, cost USD, turns, duration), powering the redesigned `/analytics` page (route name unchanged; right-sidebar entry still labelled "Analytics").

**Schema (`ai_invocations` table, per-project SQLite, migration 16):** `id, project_id, surface, surface_ref_id, ticket_id, conversation_id, model, status, started_at, finished_at, duration_ms, duration_api_ms, tokens_in/out/cache_read/cache_create, total_cost_usd, num_turns, session_id`. Indexed by `(project_id, started_at DESC)`, `(project_id, surface)`, partial `(project_id, ticket_id)`.

**Capture sites (in scope):** four spawners write a row at process exit via `recordInvocation` from `server/ai-invocations.ts`:
- `server/queue-manager.ts` — `surface='job'`, `surface_ref_id=<jobId>`, ticket id extracted from command.
- `server/project-router.ts` `POST /tickets/generate-spec` — `surface='quick-spec'`, ticket id set when ticket creation succeeds.
- `server/chat-manager.ts` — `surface='explore-spec'`, gated on `chat_conversations.kind === 'explore'` (sidebar chat is uninstrumented). One row per turn with `conversation_id`. `POST /tickets/from-draft` calls `updateTicketIdForConversation` to back-fill `ticket_id` on prior rows once the ticket is created.
- `server/agent-refine-manager.ts` — `surface='ai-edit'`, one row per refine turn.

**Out of scope:** chat sidebar (`kind='sidebar'`), setup wizard. Both spawn AI CLIs but never write to `ai_invocations`.

**Conversation kind (migration 17):** `chat_conversations.kind TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'sidebar'`. `POST /chat/conversations` accepts an optional `{ kind: 'sidebar' | 'explore' }` field. The Explore client (`ExploreSpecShell`) sends `kind: 'explore'` via `useChat.startWithMessage(text, opts, model, 'explore')`.

**Aggregation (`server/spending.ts`):** single source of truth. `getSpending(db, projectId, filters)` returns `summary` (totals + prev-period delta), `bySurface`, `byModel` (top 10), `byMode` (Quick vs Explore), `dailyTimeline` (zero-filled, stacked by surface), `scatter` (last 500 points), `topTickets` (top 10 cross-surface, with deleted-ticket and unattributed buckets). `getInvocations` powers the raw table block and exports, with `cap` for the 10k row export limit. Aggregations exclude `failed`/`aborted` rows from cost averages but include them in `totalRuns`/`failureRate`.

**REST endpoints:**
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/spending?period&surface&model&status&minCostUsd&ticketId` — dashboard data.
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/invocations?...&limit&offset` — paginated raw rows.
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/tickets/:id/spending-summary` — per-ticket aggregate used by `TicketDetailModal`.
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/analytics/export?format=csv|json&mode=summary|raw&...` — Summary CSV is a multi-section composite (`# Totals`, `# Daily timeline`, `# By surface`, `# By model`, `# Top tickets`); Raw exports up to 10 000 rows, appending `# truncated_at=N of M` when truncated. Filename pattern: `<slug>-analytics-<period>[-<surface>]-<YYYY-MM-DD>.{csv,json}`.

**WebSocket:** `recordInvocation` callsites broadcast `spending.invalidated` (project-scoped, no payload). Open dashboards debounce 500 ms then refetch.

**Client (`client/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx`):** seven blocks — sticky filter header (period + surface chips, both URL-synced), Hero burn meter (with `vs prev` delta), daily stacked timeline, Quick vs Explore card (sparse-data CTA when Explore < 5 runs), top-N model breakdown (click-to-filter), cost-vs-turns scatter, top tickets cross-surface, raw invocations table with secondary filters scoped to that block only. Surface colour mapping: `job=accent-info`, `quick-spec=accent-secondary`, `explore-spec=accent-highlight`, `ai-edit=accent-success`, `file-summary=accent-warning` (see the "Code explorer" section). Lives in `client/src/components/analytics/`.

**Ticket → Analytics deep link:** `client/src/components/TicketSpendingLine.tsx` renders a single line under the modal title (`$X · N turns · Tm Ts active · breakdown`) when the ticket has any invocations, linking to `/analytics?ticketId=<id>`.

**Export (`client/src/components/ExportDropdown.tsx`):** uses `fetch → Blob → URL.createObjectURL → anchor.click()` (works in Tauri webview; previous `window.open` path is gone). Four entries: Summary CSV/JSON, Raw CSV/JSON. Disabled when there's no data; sonner `toast.error('Export failed')` on failure. Filenames preserved from `Content-Disposition` when present.

**Tracking start:** no historical backfill. `summary.trackingStartedAt` reflects the first `started_at` in the project, surfaced in the Hero empty state ("Tracking started YYYY-MM-DD").

### Explore Contract Refine

Optional post-commit refinement that appends a structured **Contract Layer** section to every committed Explore Spec ticket, giving the downstream agent chain prescriptive anti-reinvention anchors (exact identifiers, data shapes, state machine, invariants, file touch list).

**Decision is per-spec.** The Contract Refine choice lives on `chat_conversations.context_scope.contractRefine` (Explore) or the `contractRefine` field of `POST /tickets/generate-spec` request bodies (Quick). There is no project-level default and no Settings UI — the Add Spec modal is the single decision point.

**Kill switch.** `SPECRAILS_EXPLORE_CONTRACT_REFINE=0|false|off` (case-insensitive) hub-wide disables firing across every project. This is the only ops-level escape hatch.

**Explore lifecycle (`server/contract-refine-runner.ts`).** After `POST /tickets/from-draft` returns successfully (both legacy insert and flip-in-place paths), `process.nextTick` schedules `runContractRefine(deps, conversationId, ticketId)`. The runner gates exclusively on `conversation.context_scope.contractRefine === true` (legacy null or `false` → `scope-disabled`, no spawn, no invocation row) plus the hub-wide kill switch. It then loads the parent Explore conversation, skips when `kind !== 'explore'` or no `session_id`, resolves cwd from `contextScope.mcp`, and spawns `claude` with the parent's model, `--resume <session_id>`, `--max-turns 1`, `--disallowedTools Read,Grep,Glob,Bash`, the structural system prompt, and `-p /specrails:contract-refine`. Success patches the ticket description and records `surface='explore-spec'`.

**Add Spec UI.** Explore mode uses `ContextScopeSlider` as a six-stop preset picker (`Minimal`, `Light`, `Standard`, `Rich`, `Max`, `Hub`) over the persisted five-flag `contextScope`; Contract Refine is enabled only by the `Max` and `Hub` presets unless the user opens `Fine-tune` and toggles it manually. Quick mode has a standalone `Enrich with Contract Layer` toggle whose per-project last value is stored under `config.add_spec_quick_contract_refine_last`.

**Quick lifecycle.** `POST /tickets/generate-spec` accepts `contractRefine: boolean`. When `true` and the hub-wide kill switch is inactive, `runContractRefineForQuick` spawns a fresh `claude` turn without `--resume`, seeds the system prompt with the generated title and description, reuses the Contract Layer parser/renderer/PATCH path, and records `ai_invocations.surface='quick-spec'` with `conversation_id=null` and the new ticket id.

**Retry.** `POST /api/projects/:projectId/tickets/:id/contract-refine` re-fires the refine for an existing ticket (202 scheduled / 404 unknown / 409 when the ticket has no `origin_conversation_id` or the kill switch is active). Retry is an explicit user action — the click itself is the per-ticket consent, regardless of the origin conversation's stored `contextScope.contractRefine`.

**Prompt & parser (`server/explore-contract-refine.ts`).** Pure module: `CONTRACT_PROMPT_VERSION = 1`, `buildContractRefineSystemPrompt()` (byte-stable), `parseContractLayerBlock(raw)` (drops unknown keys, defaults missing arrays to `[]`, rejects missing/non-int `contractVersion`), `renderContractLayerMarkdown(layer)` (deterministic five-subsection markdown with `_N/A_` placeholders), `appendContractLayerToDescription`, `splitDescriptionAtContractLayer`.

**Client.** `ContractRefineTrackerProvider` (mounted at `App.tsx` root) listens for `explore.contract_refine_failed` and surfaces a sonner error toast with a `Reintentar` action that POSTs the retry endpoint; `ticket_updated` events whose description carries the `\n\n---\n\n## Contract Layer\n\n` separator briefly toast success. `TicketDetailModal` splits the description at the separator and renders the Contract Layer inside a `<details>` disclosure (collapsed by default, badge showing `N/5 populated` non-N/A subsections).

**Out of scope (deferred).** Iterative refine; per-feature model override (Haiku for refine); SpecsBoard pending toast; deep ChatManager lifecycle integration (idle-kill awareness, crash auto-respawn, concurrency cap participation).

### Pipeline telemetry

Per-project opt-in feature that injects OpenTelemetry env vars into `claude` CLI spawns so the process emits OTLP/JSON signals to the hub.

**Default state**: OFF. Toggle lives in the project `SettingsPage`.

**Storage paths:**
- Raw blobs: `~/.specrails/projects/<slug>/telemetry/<jobId>.ndjson.gz` (concatenated gzip; one gzip member per received payload)
- Pointer rows: `telemetry_blobs` table in the per-project `jobs.sqlite`
- Aggregated summaries (post-compaction): `telemetry_summaries` table in `jobs.sqlite`

**Retention policy**: Blobs older than 7 days are compacted at server startup — raw file deleted, aggregates written to `telemetry_summaries`, pointer row set to `state="compacted"`. Blobs are never expired automatically beyond compaction.

**QueueManager-only scope**: OTEL env injection happens exclusively in `server/queue-manager.ts` at spawn time. `ChatManager` and `SetupManager` spawns are intentionally left uninstrumented (interactive sessions / wizard flows, not repeatable pipeline jobs).

**OTLP receiver**: `POST /otlp/v1/{traces,metrics,logs}` on the hub port. Routes signals by `specrails.job_id` + `specrails.project_id` from `resource.attributes`. Returns 400 if attributes missing, 404 if project/job unknown. 10 MB uncompressed cap per blob — logs are dropped once reached (traces/metrics continue), a `logs_truncated` control line is written exactly once.

**Export**: `GET /api/projects/:projectId/jobs/:jobId/diagnostic` streams a ZIP containing `job-metadata.json`, `telemetry.ndjson`, `logs.txt`, and `summary.md`. Export button on job cards visible iff a `telemetry_blobs` row exists (`active` or `compacted` state).

**specrails-core**: This feature is entirely hub-side. The `specrails-core` repository is intentionally not modified — the Claude CLI subprocess emits OTEL signals by reading env vars set by QueueManager.

### Code explorer (read-only)

A read-only **Code** section per project for non-developers: virtualised file tree on the left (provenance chips per file), Monaco viewer on the right with a plain-language AI summary header. Gated by `VITE_FEATURE_CODE_EXPLORER` (client) and `SPECRAILS_CODE_EXPLORER` (server) — both default ON / opt-out (`feature-flags.ts` returns `true` unless the flag is the string `"false"`); set either to `"false"` to disable. Read-only — no in-app editing in v1.

**Server modules:**
- `server/file-provenance.ts` — `snapshotWorkingTree` / `diffAgainstSnapshot` / `recordProvenanceForJob` / `listProvenanceByTicket` / `listProvenanceByPath` / `broadcastProvenanceUpdated`. Per-project SQLite table `file_provenance(id, file_path, ticket_id, job_id, kind, at)` (migration 22), indexed on `file_path`, `ticket_id`, `at DESC`.
- `server/file-summary-manager.ts` — `FileSummaryManager` class. Hash-gated regeneration (sha256 of file contents is the invalidation key), per-project concurrency 2, hub-wide 8, per-job cap 50, monthly budget cap (hub setting `summary_monthly_budget_usd`, default $5; user-initiated `overrideBudget` bypasses), chokidar stale-marking (no auto-regenerate on user edits), orphan sweep capped at 200/pass. Summaries live at `<project>/.specrails/file-summaries/<sha256-of-relative-path>.json`. Schema validated by `server/schemas/file-summary.v1.json`. `.gitignore` line `.specrails/file-summaries/` appended idempotently on first write (commit to share with team if desired).
- `server/code-explorer-router.ts` — mounted under `/api/projects/:projectId/code`, returns 404 when `SPECRAILS_CODE_EXPLORER=false`. Endpoints: `GET /tree?withProvenance=1&filter=touched-by-ai|all&cursor=…` (pagination cap 2000, deny-list, `.gitignore` respect), `GET /file?path=…` (binary refusal, 2 MB cap, path-traversal guard), `GET /summary?path=…`, `POST /file/regenerate-summary?path=…` (body `{ overrideBudget? }` → 202 `{ enqueued: true }`), `GET /provenance?ticketId=…`. **Reserved paths (hub-managed)**: `<project>/.specrails/file-summaries/**`.

**QueueManager hook**: pre-spawn `snapshotWorkingTree(cwd)` (stored on `_snapshotRefs: Map<jobId,ref>`), post-exit `diffAgainstSnapshot` → `recordProvenanceForJob` (primary ticket = first id from `tickets[]` extraction) → broadcast per row. Both gated by `isCodeExplorerEnabled()`. Per-job warning `provenance.large_job` when >50 paths (still inserts all rows; the 50-cap applies only to summary enqueues).

**ai_invocations integration**: every `FileSummaryManager` model call writes a row with `surface='file-summary'`, surfacing cost on `/analytics` (Hero, By Surface, Daily Timeline use `accent-warning`). `spending.invalidated` is broadcast on each row. Cross-reference: the Project spending analytics section now lists `file-summary` alongside `job`, `quick-spec`, `explore-spec`, `ai-edit`, `smash`.

**WebSocket events** (project-scoped via `boundBroadcast`): `file.provenance_updated`, `file.summary_updated`, `file.summary_failed`, `file.summary_skipped` (`reason: 'budget'|'per-job-cap'|'ttl'|'not-found'`).

**Hub settings** (`GET/PATCH /api/hub/code-explorer-settings`): `summary_language` (`'en'`|`'es'`, default `'en'`), `summary_monthly_budget_usd` (default `5.00`). Surfaced in `GlobalSettingsPage` under "Code section", hidden when client flag is off.

**Client**: `client/src/pages/CodePage.tsx` (two-pane), `client/src/components/code-explorer/` (`FileTree`, `FileViewer`, `SummaryHeader`, `CodeViewerMonaco`, `TicketFilesTouched`). Monaco loaded via dynamic `import()` so the main route chunk is unaffected when the flag is off; web workers configured via `client/src/lib/monaco-setup.ts` (Vite `?worker` imports, no `monaco-editor-vite-plugin`). Theme bound to `useActiveTheme()`. URL-synced selection (`?path=<rel>`). Filter `Tocado por IA` (default) ⇄ `All files` persisted to `localStorage['specrails-hub:code-tree-filter:<projectId>']`. Chip clicks open `TicketDetailModal` via `TicketDetailModalProvider`. `TicketDetailModal` adds a "Files touched by this ticket" section (lazy-fetched, hidden when empty; row click navigates to `/code` and closes the modal).

**v1 limitations (out of scope)**: in-app editing, per-symbol summaries, narrative diff view, conversational "ask the AI about this file", directory-level summaries, multi-ticket attribution (primary ticket only). The Monaco viewer surfaces an "Edit in external editor" button that copies the absolute path as a stopgap.

**Rollback**: set both flags off. `file_provenance` rows and `<project>/.specrails/file-summaries/` files remain on disk; migrations are additive.
