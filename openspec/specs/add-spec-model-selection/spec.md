# add-spec-model-selection Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change select-model-in-add-spec. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Model picker in Add Spec modal

The Add Spec modal SHALL render a single-model dropdown picker that is visible and operable in both Quick and Explore tabs. The picker MUST persist its selection when the user toggles between Quick and Explore within a single modal session. The picker MUST reset its selection when the modal closes and reopens.

#### Scenario: Picker is visible in both modes
- **WHEN** the user opens Add Spec
- **THEN** a model dropdown is rendered alongside the Quick / Explore tab control
- **AND** the same dropdown remains visible after toggling between Quick and Explore

#### Scenario: Selection persists across mode toggle within a session
- **WHEN** the user picks `opus` while in Quick mode
- **AND** switches to Explore mode without closing the modal
- **THEN** the dropdown still shows `opus` selected

#### Scenario: Selection resets on modal close
- **WHEN** the user picks `opus`, closes the modal, and reopens it
- **THEN** the dropdown shows the project's resolved default model selected

### Requirement: Provider-aware model list

The picker SHALL list only models valid for the active project's `provider`. Projects with `provider=claude` MUST see the Claude model list; projects with `provider=codex` MUST see the Codex model list. The model lists MUST be sourced from the server's `GET /api/projects/:projectId/default-spec-model` response (`allowed` field) — the client MUST NOT maintain its own copy of the provider model lists for this picker.

#### Scenario: Claude project shows Claude models
- **WHEN** the user opens Add Spec on a `provider=claude` project
- **THEN** the dropdown lists every entry from `CLAUDE_MODELS` and no Codex entries

#### Scenario: Codex project shows Codex models
- **WHEN** the user opens Add Spec on a `provider=codex` project
- **THEN** the dropdown lists every entry from `CODEX_MODELS` and no Claude entries

### Requirement: Default selection resolves from project config

On modal open, the picker's preselected value SHALL resolve in this order:
1. The project's `models.defaults.model` from `.specrails/install-config.yaml`, if it parses successfully AND is in the provider's allow-list.
2. The provider default (`sonnet` for `claude`, `gpt-5.4-mini` for `codex`).

The resolved default MUST be returned by a server endpoint (no client-side parsing of `install-config.yaml`).

#### Scenario: Project config default is honored
- **GIVEN** the project's install-config has `models.defaults.model: opus`
- **WHEN** the user opens Add Spec
- **THEN** the dropdown preselects `opus`

#### Scenario: Provider default fallback
- **GIVEN** the project has no readable `install-config.yaml`
- **WHEN** the user opens Add Spec on a Claude project
- **THEN** the dropdown preselects `sonnet`

#### Scenario: Invalid configured default falls back to provider default
- **GIVEN** the project's install-config references a model not in the provider's allow-list
- **WHEN** the user opens Add Spec
- **THEN** the dropdown preselects the provider default
- **AND** the server logs a warning identifying the invalid configured value

### Requirement: Quick mode submits selected model to generate-spec

In Quick mode, the modal's submit action SHALL include the picker's current value in the `POST /tickets/generate-spec` request body as `model`. The server SHALL use this value as the model for the spawned `claude` or `codex` process.

#### Scenario: Model is sent in body
- **WHEN** the user picks `haiku`, types an idea in Quick mode, and clicks `Generate Spec`
- **THEN** the request body includes `model: "haiku"` alongside `idea`, `attachmentIds`, `pendingSpecId`

#### Scenario: Server uses the model in the spawn args
- **GIVEN** a request body with `model: "opus"` on a `provider=claude` project
- **WHEN** the server spawns the `claude` process
- **THEN** the spawn args include `--model opus`

#### Scenario: Codex provider receives the model
- **GIVEN** a request body with `model: "gpt-5.4"` on a `provider=codex` project
- **WHEN** the server spawns the `codex` process
- **THEN** the spawn args include `--model gpt-5.4`

### Requirement: Explore mode seeds conversation with selected model

In Explore mode, the launch handler SHALL pass the picker's current value as `model` on the launch payload, and the server SHALL persist it as the conversation's `model` field from creation. Every subsequent assistant turn in the conversation MUST use that same model.

#### Scenario: Launch payload carries model
- **WHEN** the user picks `opus` and clicks `Continue` in Explore mode
- **THEN** the `onExploreLaunch` payload includes `model: "opus"`

#### Scenario: Conversation row stores the chosen model
- **WHEN** the Explore conversation is created from the launch payload
- **THEN** the conversation's `model` column equals the value from the launch payload

#### Scenario: Every turn uses the chosen model
- **GIVEN** an Explore conversation created with `model: "haiku"`
- **WHEN** the user sends three messages in a row
- **THEN** all three assistant responses are generated by `haiku`

### Requirement: No model-change UI downstream of Add Spec

The model combo box SHALL exist in exactly one place: the Add Spec modal. No surface reached after submitting Add Spec — including but not limited to the Explore overlay header, the Explore composer, the Explore restore-from-minimize flow, the Create Spec migration dialog, and the Quick-mode loading toast — SHALL render any control that mutates the chosen model. Once the user submits Add Spec, the model is immutable for the lifetime of that spec generation flow.

#### Scenario: Explore overlay shows no model picker
- **WHEN** the Explore overlay is mounted after Add Spec submit
- **THEN** no `<Select>`, dropdown, or button labeled or behaving as a model switcher is present anywhere in the overlay (header, composer, draft panel)

#### Scenario: Restored Explore session shows no model picker
- **WHEN** a minimized Explore session is restored from the dock
- **THEN** the restored overlay still shows no model-change UI
- **AND** the conversation continues to use its persisted model

#### Scenario: Quick toast shows no model picker
- **WHEN** the Quick generation toast is visible after submit
- **THEN** the toast offers no control to change the model

#### Scenario: Create Spec migration dialog shows no model picker
- **WHEN** the user clicks `Create Spec` from the Explore overlay
- **THEN** any confirmation or migration UI rendered shows no model-change control

### Requirement: Server validates model against provider allow-list

`POST /tickets/generate-spec` SHALL validate the `model` field against the active project's provider allow-list before spawning. Invalid values MUST result in HTTP 400 with a body of `{ error: string, allowed: string[] }` and MUST NOT spawn any subprocess. Missing or empty values MUST fall back to the project's resolved default model.

#### Scenario: Valid model is accepted
- **WHEN** a request arrives with `model: "sonnet"` on a Claude project
- **THEN** the server proceeds to spawn with `--model sonnet`

#### Scenario: Invalid model is rejected
- **WHEN** a request arrives with `model: "claude-vintage-2"` on a Claude project
- **THEN** the response status is 400
- **AND** the response body includes `allowed` listing the valid Claude model ids
- **AND** no subprocess is spawned

#### Scenario: Missing model falls back to default
- **WHEN** a request arrives with no `model` field
- **THEN** the server resolves the project's default model
- **AND** spawns the subprocess with that default
