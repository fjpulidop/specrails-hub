/**
 * Shared deny-set of directory segment names that hold build output, vendored
 * dependencies, or VCS metadata. These trees can contain tens of thousands of
 * constantly-rewritten files (e.g. a Rust `target/` or a Tauri `src-tauri/target`
 * with the assembled app bundle) and must never be recursively watched or walked.
 *
 * Recursively watching such a tree was the confirmed root cause of a file-descriptor
 * leak (~10k fds) that, under fd pressure, made node-pty's forkpty fail to give the
 * child shell a controlling tty — the shell then read EOF and exited instantly,
 * producing dead/hung terminals. See server/file-summary-manager.ts (the watcher)
 * and server/code-explorer-router.ts (the on-demand tree walk).
 *
 * Dot-directories (`.git`, `.next`, `.turbo`, `.venv`, …) are handled separately
 * by a `startsWith('.')` segment check so we don't have to enumerate every one.
