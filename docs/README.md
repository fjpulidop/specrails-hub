# specrails-hub documentation

Welcome. These guides are written for **you, the user**: how to get specrails-hub running, how to use each feature, and what to do when something looks off.

If you're contributing to the hub itself or building on its API, head over to [`internals/`](internals/) for the technical deep dive.

## Start here

1. [Getting started](getting-started.md) — install the hub, register your first project, run your first pipeline. ~10 minutes.

## Doing things

| Guide | Use it when… |
|-------|-------------|
| [Creating specs](creating-specs.md) | …you want to draft a spec, compare two specs, save a draft, split a big epic, or refine an existing spec |
| [Running pipelines](running-pipelines.md) | …you want to launch the AI pipeline against a spec, manage rails, pick agent profiles, or install plugins |
| [Using Codex](codex.md) | …you added a project with OpenAI's Codex CLI instead of (or alongside) Claude |
| [Tracking cost](tracking-cost.md) | …you want to see what AI is costing you and which specs are the most expensive |
| [Customising the hub](customizing.md) | …you want to change theme, configure settings, set a budget, or turn on telemetry |
| [Terminal panel](terminal.md) | …you want to use the built-in terminal: shortcuts, shell integration, drag-and-drop |
| [CLI reference](cli.md) | …you want to drive specrails-hub from the terminal instead of (or alongside) the dashboard |

## Platform-specific notes

- [macOS](platforms/macos.md) — Finder/Dock launches, PATH resolution, broken-symlink diagnostics
- [Windows](platforms/windows.md) — installer formats, SmartScreen, PowerShell, ConPTY
